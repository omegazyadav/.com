Hi! I'm **Yadav Lamichhane**, a **Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Cloudfactory**.  
I specialize in **Linux systems, container runtimes, and kernel internals**, and I love exploring and contributing to open-source projects.

Outside of work, you'll usually find me **cycling, working out, playing cricket, reading**, or **writing blogs**.  
I'm also one of the organizing members of the **DevOps Kathmandu** community.
