I'm a Computer Engineer and currently work as a Sr. Site Reliability Engineer at Cloudfactory.
I'm passionate about Linux, container runtimes, and kernel internals, and I enjoy exploring and contributing to open-source projects.

Outside of work, I love cycling, working out, playing cricket, reading, and writing blogs.
I'm also one of the organizing members of the DevOps Kathmandu community.
